# Rule for the Game.
You have a 9*9 grid which makes a total of 81 boxes.
Out of these 81 boxes 10 boxes contain bomb and other boxes are normal.
If a normal box is clicked, the user is awarded a point and if a user clicks on a
box containing a bomb, the game gets over (GAME OVER!) and you need to
give an option to the user to start a fresh game.

# This is how you may proceed:
	1.Create an array of random numbers where each number lies between 1 to 81.

	2.Every number in the array should be unique.

	3.The numbers in the array are nothing but indices where the bomb is planted.

	4.If a bomb is clicked you need to highlight all the boxes that contained bomb
	with red color.

	5.You need to distinguish the boxes which have been clicked and which have
	not been clicked. (As a standard you may color clicked boxes with green color
	and boxes which have not been clicked should remain white).

	6.As soon as a box containing bomb is clicked you need to color that box red.

	7.If the user makes 71 guesses and still has not clicked on a bomb you need
	to notify the user with the message "Congratulations you won the game"

	8.After a user completes the game or clicks the bomb box, he should be asked
	to start afresh game.

	9.User should be able to play the game on every device(desktop, mobile or a tab)
